# Big_Data_Hadoop
Big Data Hadoop Project

This is a Hadoop project that takes Yelp Reviews (JSON objects) as input and uses the words (as tokens) in a review to predict what 
the review's Star Rating will be.  The two algorithms in play are Naive Bayes Multinomial and Multivariate Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
